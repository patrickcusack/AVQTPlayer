Command Line Client has a callback that pulls the currentSurfaceID
	The surface ID is passed as a unique ID across a pipe to another process
		you get the CVPixelBuffer and grab its surface ID
			the <em>CVPixelBuffer</em> is kept in queue and has a time value associated with it
				the CVPixelBuffers come from <em>QTVisualContextCopyImageForTime</em> which is invoked in a callback on the movie
				you register to get callbacks with <em>QTVisualContextSetImageAvailableCallback</em> from a context that you have defined
					<em>QTPixelBufferContextCreate</em>
